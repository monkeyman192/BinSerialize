# BinSerialize

Easily serialize and deserialize binary data using python.

## What does it do?

*BinSerialize* is makes it much easier to write code to deserialize and reserialize binary data file for many purposes such as data conversion for game modding or scientific purposes.

Instead of having to write lots of extra code to create objects that can read binary data into them and then write it back, each class can be simply constructed with the necessary properties and data types and (de)serialization comes automatically!

## Easily extendable!

Because there are unlimited ways that data can be stored in a binary format, *BinSerialize* makes it easy to add your own functions that can be used to read and write data.
